========================== GENERAL ==========================
    - Hold the tilt button to ensure you won't dash, spotdodge, roll, etc...
    It is a good idea to hold tilt when in shield, unless you want to shield drop
    or Up-B out of shield.

    - L is meant for wavedashing. It temporarily disables tilt when pushed to
    ensure proper angles even in Project M.

    - Press cUp while in shield to toggle light shield on and off.

    - tilt + lsUp + cXAxis = Upward forward smash.
    - tilt + lsDown + cXAxis = Downward forward smash.

    - While macros are enabled, wavedash with L and waveland with R.



========================== SETUP ==========================
    - Hold dPadRight for 3 seconds = Toggle macros on and off.
    - Hold UnusedButton = Temporarily L is normal and Y switches with X.

Wavedash macro:

    - UnusedButton + cUp = Increase jumpsquat time by 1 frame.
    - UnusedButton + cDown = Decrease jumpsquat time by 1 frame.

    - You can't trim the jumpsquat time below 3 (default value) or higher than 8.

Spam BA macro:

    - B first + A = Spam B really fast.
    - B first + A + cDown = Alternate between B and A really fast.

Analog trimming:

    - xMod1 + UnusedButton + A = Turn on Melee Mode.
    - xMod1 + UnusedButton + B = Turn on Project M Mode.

Use these combos to trim the left analog stick if calibration is bad:

    - xMod1 + UnusedButton + cUp = Trim left stick yAxis up.
    - xMod1 + UnusedButton + cDown = Trim left stick yAxis down.
    - xMod1 + UnusedButton + cRight = Trim left stick xAxis to the right.
    - xMod1 + UnusedButton + cLeft = Trim left stick xAxis to the left.
