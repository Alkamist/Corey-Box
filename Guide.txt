=========================== CALIBRATION ===========================

-b first then a = spam b
-b first then a then c down = spam b and a alternating

-dpad mod + analog direction = respective dpad direction
-all analog mods + dpad mod = turn off macros
-all analog mods + dpad up shortcut = turn macros on

-settings button 1 + c up = make wavedash slower
-settings button 1 + c down = make wavedash faster

-settings button 2 + r = dolphin timing
-settings button 2 + z = console timing

-settings button 2 + c direction = trim analog values in respective direction

-settings button 2 + analog up = melee mode
-settings button 2 + analog down = project m mode
-settings button 2 + analog left = rivals mode

=========================== TIPS ===========================

-almost always hold tilt while in shield.

-tilt + either x mod + reverse analog direction + up = quick turnaround uptilt
-tilt + analog up or down + c left or right = respective angled f-smash

-to moonwalk: while walking, hold the direction you are walking, push the opposite direction, then tilt,
then quickly let go of the opposite direction and tilt and keep holding the walking direction.

-make sure to change the timing depending if you are on dolphin or console. the controller starts in console timing.
-the timing can get slightly messed up depending on what controllers are plugged in on dolphin. plug in additional
controllers to fix it.
